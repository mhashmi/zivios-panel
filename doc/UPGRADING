* Upgrading from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1
--------------------------------
No upgrade path is available between Zivios 0.5.0 and 0.5.1

Though the upgrade _is_ possibly manually, it would be a tedious task as the initial
core ldif which is auto-generated has been altered. We have also included a schema
which was unfortunately missing in the initial release. These schemas are imported
by Zivios during the automated installation

Though we recommend a clean installation, if an upgrade is unavoidable, please discuss
this with us on the mailing list -- we'll try and help. Mailing lists are available at:
